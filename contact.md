## About Me
Hello! My name is **Khanh Tran**.  
I was a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at Nguyen lab, JAIST, Japan. My research experience covers Deep Learning for Natural Language Generation, Natural Language Processing. 
I am particularly excited about recurrent neural networks, deep generative models, and the scientific applications of deep learning. 

## Research Interests
* Deep Learning, Machine Learning
* Natural Language Generation, Natural Language Processing, Dialogue Systems, Chitchat
* Deep Learning for Realated Areas
