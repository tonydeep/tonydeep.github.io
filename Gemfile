ruby RUBY_VERSION

# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. 
#   I. Building your site locally
	# 1. Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information about publishing sources, see "About GitHub Pages."
    # 2. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
		# $ bundle exec jekyll serve
		# > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
		# >            Source: /Users/octocat/my-site
		# >       Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site
		# > Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
		# >      Generating...
		# >                    done in 0.309 seconds.
		# > Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site'
		# > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
		# >    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
		# >  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
	# 3. To preview your site, in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000.

#   II. Updating the GitHub Pages gem
	# Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. 
	# If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, 
	# your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. 
	# To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

	# 1. Open Terminal.
	# 2. Update the github-pages gem.
	# 	- If you installed Bundler, run `bundle update github-pages`.
	# 	- If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem update github-pages`.


# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
#gem "jekyll", "3.4.3"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
   gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
